          Before I moved to paris, I was afraid of eating alone, at a table by myself, in public, for anyone to see.
          I have no idea why the idea was so terrifying, but I'm not the only person wo has ever felt that way.

          It wasn't until last year during a warm spring day in May that I found myself in this completely new quite intimidating situation. 
          But to get past your fears you have to face them, right? So that's what I did. I sat down at Costume Café and had brunch, all by myself.
          Sure, the first few minutes were a bit awkward. And no, it did not help that the to gentlemen at the table beside me giggled every time they
          looked my may. Do I have something get stuck between my teeth? Did I pronouce 'jus de fruits' completely wrong?

          I don't drink coffee in Paris. Why should I? It's expensive and mostly bad and the waiters are often surly and unfriendly. 
          No self-respecting coffee drinker should have to subject themselves to overpriced Parisian sludge served with a sneer.
